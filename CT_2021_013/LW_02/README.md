# Lab Worksheet: Java Programming Fundamentals

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains solutions to various Java programming problems, covering fundamental concepts such as mathematical computations, user input handling, and financial calculations.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
Each question has been implemented as a separate Java file, following the naming convention `Q_0X.java` (where `X` is the question number). The programs take user input, perform calculations, and display the required output.

## 📝 Lab Tasks

### 🔹 Mathematical Computations:
- **Q_01**: Compute mathematical expressions using Java.
- **Q_02**: Convert centimeters to feet and inches.
- **Q_03**: Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- **Q_04**: Calculate daily calorie requirements based on weight.
- **Q_05**: Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius.
- **Q_06**: Determine a person's age based on birth year.
- **Q_07**: Compute the Body Mass Index (BMI).
- **Q_08**: Calculate the volume of a sphere.
- **Q_09**: Compute compound interest over time.
- **Q_10**: Implement a loan calculator to compute monthly and total payments.
