# 📘 Lab Worksheets - Java Programming

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains solutions to multiple **Java Lab Worksheets**, covering fundamental programming concepts such as **mathematical computations, user input handling, GUI programming, string manipulation, date and time handling, object-oriented programming, and financial calculations**.

Each worksheet is structured into **separate Java files**, following a consistent naming convention (`Q_0X.java` for each question). The repository provides a **step-by-step approach to mastering Java**, making it a useful resource for students and developers.

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

Each lab worksheet is stored in a separate folder, containing multiple Java programs:

## 📝 Lab Worksheets Included

### 🔹 **Lab 1: Java Basics**
- **Q_01 to Q_10**: Mathematical expressions, unit conversions, temperature calculations, calorie computations, and loan calculations.

### 🔹 **Lab 2: String Manipulation & GUI Programming**
- **Q_01 to Q_12**: Java Swing GUI applications, string formatting, and basic user interface handling.

### 🔹 **Lab 3: Date & Time Handling**
- **Q_01 to Q_05**: Working with dates, time formats, and calendar-based calculations.

### 🔹 **Lab 4: Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Q_01 to Q_06**: Implementation of Java **classes, objects, constructors, inheritance**, and basic OOP concepts.

### 🔹 **Lab 5: Data Structures & Exception Handling**
- **Q_01 to Q_07**: Arrays, lists, stacks, file handling, and exception handling using **try-catch-finally** blocks.

## 🚀 How to Run the Programs

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PulasthiRanabah1/CT-2021-013.git
   
2.Navigate to the desired Lab Folder.

3.Open the Java file (e.g., Q_01.java) in IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java IDE.

4.Run the Java program and enter input as prompted.

📄 Additional Notes
Each Lab Folder contains its own README.md file explaining the problems.

Screenshots and results of program execution are included in relevant documentation files.
